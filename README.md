# particle_dynamic
This is a dynamic simulation of particles under certain interaction, for example gravity or vdW force. It is created completely out of hobby.

#input
The initial states of the particle assemble is via a txt file, which includes 6 columns.
First two columns are initial X and Y coordinates, in range of -100 to 100.
Next two columns are initial Vx and Vy, then mass, finally a flag variable.
The column number can change in the future, adding more properties to the assemble, say charge, radius, etc.
